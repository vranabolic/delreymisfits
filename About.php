		<p>Prince Andrew is the man that started it all and the man behind the camera.
		 Born in New York he later moved to Florida he always loved to film and edit videos,
		he would also film and edit all of Jason Genovas videos until the two of them had a split over the "Cameragate" 
		incident where Jason ignored his longtime friends warnings not to give a stranger the password to all his accounts after 
		being tempted by a camera.After that, Andrew started up the Delray Misfits series proper, but did eventually reconcile with Jason, 
		although he no longer edited and uploaded his videos for him. Andrews humourous commentary overlays every video. 
		Even professional bodybuilders know about them. During the fitness expo in Vegas they were the main attraction even if they are not professional bodybuilders.

		Its difficult to describe who the misfits are, the best way to explain to someone who they are and what they do is to just play them a video.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIe_TwBrUOQ&t=1025s&ab_channel=MrSnowflake">MR Snowfalke has started a video series about the history of the Delrey Misfits</a> 
		Although Jason Genova is the main attraction, he does not provide the ments alone.</p>
		<p>Affter some years of filming fans of the misfits started creating their own videos about them.Most videos were about how 
			Brad is insulting Jason because hes is  lying,trying to take money from fans or when he starts talking about being a pro bodybuilder.
