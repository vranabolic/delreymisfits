		<p>The Delray Misfits is a YouTube series that followed the escapades of various characters working out in World Gym (formerly Delray Fitness) in Delray Beach, Florida.</p>
		<p>It was a spin off of the Jason Genova YouTube channel after the "Chad betrayal camera incident" in which Jason split with his longtime producer and friend over a cheap digital camera.</p>
		<p>Fans urged Andrew to continue filming without Jason, and he decided to make videos centred around Big Richard, with some other characters in the gym acting as a supporting cast (some who were known from previous Jason Genova videos, and some new ones).</p>
        <p>Delray Misfits episode 1 made its debut and soon became a lost episode; it had to be taken down due to inappropriate language. </p>
		<p>Before the first episode was taken down it got a good amount of positive feedback.</p>
		<p>YouTube is not the main source of income that is why fans respect the work they put into the videos.</p>
